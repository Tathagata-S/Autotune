Description: This package fits lasso path for high-dimensional regression using coordinate descent while automatically tuning it's regularization parameter.Autotune Lasso is 10-50 times than the standard glmnet implementation of lasso, and over 100 times faster than scaled lasso. Additionally, it gives reliable noise level estimate for the regression problem.
